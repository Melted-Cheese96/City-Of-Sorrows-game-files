City of sorrows is a town somewhere near Gary Indiana, it's generally known for it's high crime rate and weird/strange disappearances. The tavern is a regular hotspot for hooligans and thugs. This place is generally called the 'City of Sorrows' because of how many people who live there work in dead end jobs. The streets are riddled with shit and looks like a dump. Police are corrupt, only one hospital in the whole city, gangs are very prominent in the area, mostly one notorious group of thugs that are led by one little boy, he mostly hangs around the park, so be careful around there! People have been speculating for years now that there's a secret network of underground tunnels beneath the city, no person has ever been brave enough to venture down into these 'tunnels' those are just rumours though, right?
